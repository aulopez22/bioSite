          Jesus A. Valdez Tello is a father of three children and loves soccer. He was born and raised in Mexico. At a young age he developed a love for soccer. 
     He played in the streets, fields and anywhere he was allowed a ball. At the age of eight he came to the United States. After arriving, to the U.S. he played 
     for different local and school clubs. He has won a multitude of tournaments and leagues. He was also awarded several MVPs and received the highest scorer 
     from different leagues and tournaments.

         Although he has won many times throughout his life, the biggest reward that he states has been the best was being able to be the father of Emma, Zoe and 
     Hiro. He and his wife live in Portland, Oregon and have made a home for their little ones. Jesus continues his love for soccer by playing in different adult 
     leagues, coaching his children and by officiating different levels of soccer. He states that refereeing has brought  in a whole different insight to the 
     game. He commented that because he officiates his play on the field has improved because he has a greater understanding of the game.

        Currently he is playing in three different leagues and is officiating again after finally the governor of the state lifted the mandate of sport games. 
    “COVID-19 has made a lasting impact on everyone”,, states Jesus, “but, it has proven the importance of our passions and its importance on our mental 
    healths.” Jesus spends most of his time taking his kids to the soccer field. Although, it still is quite sure if the trip to the park is for the kids or for 
    him.
